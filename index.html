          <p>I have always been interested in the use and operation of computers from a young age. It's always been on the periphery of everything I've done, from programming as a child, to making basic websites over the years and in the past few years building computers from parts and running a mining rig for fun. I see a career in software development as a way to satisfy my desire to create and be creative whilst continually learning within an ever changing industry. Since completing Makers I have coded every day, learning and trying out new things with the aim of being a better coder. I enjoy the element of problem solving and the challenges it provides. Learning to code is the best thing in terms of education I've ever done.</p>
          <p>I have completed a range of self-driven projects, coding challenges and enjoy trying out various languages. I find inspiration from a whole range of situations. Recently I completed a chrome extension that is available on the chrome store that involves suggesting government petitions based on the news article someone is reading at the time. My idea came from the revoke article 50 online petition news coverage a few months ago. Currently I’m working on code to display the hygiene ratings of restaurants listed on major food delivery platforms in the form of a chrome extension as currently these are not readily available on their site. This idea came about from watching a Joel Lycett programme where he exposed that ubereats doesn’t check hygiene ratings and lists restaurants that aren’t even restaurants! In between I recently tried out Java for the first time writing a basic API and word game. I think these examples reflect how creative and innovative I am. Being interested in all aspects of code, I also set up an ubuntu server with Nginx at home on a spare PC and currently am hosting my own personal website.</p>
          <p>Before attending the Makers coding academy I was helping individual children who were on Education Health Care Plans who had a diagnosis of Autism/ADHD and general behavioural needs within a school. I supported a class teacher with the day to day running of the class, primarily focusing on certain groups of children to help them achieve. I have also in the past worked in varying environments most notably various roles at the Science Museum.</p>
          <p>I am very creative, I've been involved in music and performing most of my life. I have a keen interest and appreciation for many forms of art. I have managed to incorporate this into my work; such as teaching children and also designing album covers/posters for many years. I have worked with a wide variety of people throughout my life, I have been told people appreciate my patient and calm demeanour but also people note how positive and enthusiastic I can be about work! I have a real love of learning. Whether it's learning new tech and applying what I have learnt throughout the Makers course, I use my initiative to build on what I know.</p>
          <p>I value being supported to continue learning and to practically apply the skills I've learned on the job. I value a positive, collaborative working environment where ideas can be freely voiced.</p>
