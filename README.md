# Personal website

Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a website to showcase me. Also an exercise is using CSS grid and CSS in general. 

All graphics were done by myself in Photoshop. The svg files were animated in svgator and tweaked once in place.

A work in progress!

Website is deployed on heroku [here](http://jimmysutherland.herokuapp.com)!
