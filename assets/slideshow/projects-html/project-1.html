<div class="projects-info">
  Final project at Makers. Worked in a team using Agile and XP practices to
  create a frontend web app game. All written with React and tested with
  Jest/Enzyme and Cypress. Learnt the fundamentals of React, expanding
  JavaScript knowledge and applied testing principals I had learnt using Jest
  and Cypress for the first time.

  <ul>
    <li>Tickets created using waffle.io and CI using Travis</li>
    <li>Daily stand ups and two day sprints (12 day project)</li>
    <li>Mixture of pair and individual programming</li>
    <li>Reviewed each others code on each PR</li>
  </ul>

  I was one of four in the team and I worked on all aspects of the project.
  In the final week I concentrated on the top down part of the game which was
  essentially vanilla JS imported into React. Overall aesthetic of the game in
  the planning stage was suggested by myself.

  Also I asked questions of coaches, read official docs, referred to stack
  overflow and other available information and also to my past projects.
