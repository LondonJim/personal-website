  Currently the text message you add is converted to the character key integer
  then to binary. The image is broken down into into pixels and then each pixel
  containing four pieces of information (RGBA) is broken down to binary. One bit
  at a time from the converted text is inserted into the first bit of the red
  pixels(at the moment). When reading the image the opposite is essentially done.
  Unless you knew what to look for there is no way you could tell the message was
  there. Learning to use canvas and how to manipulate the data. Searching for how
  to test the loading of a file in Cypress took some research and from online
  sources.
